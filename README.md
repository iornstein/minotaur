# Minotaur
Minotaur will display helpful information about your project! Right now the documented behavior is that it can
display the days since you have last deployed since production. Hopefully this can remind you to keep that number
as low as possible `:)`.

## how to run
You can run this with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/). Simply run `docker-compose up --build`. 
You can visit the front-end at `http:localhost:3000`
